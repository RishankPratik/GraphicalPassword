# GraphicalPassword

User authentication is an important way to ensure the security of your cyber account. Although there are various authentication methods such as iris and fingerprint, passwords will be the main authentication method for the time being due to their low cost and ease of implementation. But this ease of implementation is also a factor which makes it less secure compared to other methods. We have tried to design a system, based on images and grids and to develop a new system with the same ease of implementation but with more security with respect to common attacks. We have incorporated the principles used in captcha and pass point methods and developed a new system altogether which is developed as a module and can be integrated with any existing portal or system.

## Safe from:
1. Brute Force Attacks
2. Dictionary Attacks
3. Session Sniping
4. Keyloggers
5. Shoulder Surfing
